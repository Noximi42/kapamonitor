## Config
You need <i>Docker</i> and a Unix-shell to start the whole projekt. <br />
Alternatively use <i>npm run start</i> to start the client from its directory (you won't have the api available).

## Makefile

We offer a Makefile to start, stop, rebuild... the containers. 

```sh
# prints available commands
make help

# build and start all containers
make up

# stop all containers
make stop
```
