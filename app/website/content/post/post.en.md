In the current crisis, KapaMonitor helps to identify needs in the health sector on the one hand and available resources (e.g. medical equipment, hospital beds, staff) on the other hand and to present them clearly for decision makers. In this way, resources can be allocated centrally to facilities and bottlenecks can be prevented.

#### TL;DR KapaMonitor is a pro bono project with no company behind it and no commercial interests!

### The goal is to make the application:
- to provide an overview for decision makers such as control centres or persons responsible for disaster control of bed occupancy and resource requirements of health facilities, as well as of resources available through third parties.

- to give institutions like hospitals a platform on which they can indicate their needs and try to find offers.

- Provide a platform for providers of capacities and resources to make these needs visible and report available resources.

#### Resources can be e.g. localities, (non-)medical equipment or staff. 

### How do we make a difference?

Many solutions focus exclusively on optimising bed utilisation by redistribution between hospitals. With KapaMonitor, we pursued the idea of complementing this approach early on by opening up alternatives to non-medical facilities that could be used for patients with non-critical diseases.

The application is open source and free of rights and license fees. It can be extended to a wide variety of use cases, is scalable and technically designed for large-scale implementation. This project also takes into account the responsibilities in disaster control and is therefore ideally suited for use at state level. A nationwide introduction of the platform KapaMonitor is expected to be possible by 01.06.2020.
